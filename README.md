### Hi, I’m Annelisa 👋

I'm a content strategist, content designer, and communicator with leadership experience across both UX content and marketing content. If it's got words or visuals on it, I've probably worked on it: apps, blogs, websites, tweets, videos, press releases, screenplays, books, flyers, signage.

At GitHub I’m currently a senior content manager focusing on serving the needs of developers through UX content strategy and design.
